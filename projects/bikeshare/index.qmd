## Overview

![](images/OverviewDashboard.png){fig-cap="Overview Dashboard: key KPIs, hourly usage, and station activity (Mar 2023 vs Mar 2024)"}

This analysis explores how **Bike Share Toronto** usage changed between **March 2023** and **March 2024**, focusing on hourly ridership, weekday vs weekend, and member vs casual mix.  
The project shows a clear workflow from **Excel cleaning** to **Tableau dashboards**, with decisions logged for transparency. The new **Financial Extension** adds a simple revenue–cost–profit view based on public pricing and documented assumptions.

## Project Purpose

### Motivation
Living in Mississauga, I rarely saw Lime scooters or shared bikes in active use. Many looked idle or abandoned mid-trip.  
That raised a question: **are these systems being used effectively, or just growing in size?**

I tried to access Lime GBFS but the process stalled, so I pivoted to **Bike Share Toronto open data**, which is clean and well structured. The work evolved into a **business-style analysis** that checks if **ridership growth** kept pace with **network expansion**.

### Core Question
> How did Bike Share Toronto usage differ between **March 2023** and **March 2024** by hour, by weekday vs weekend, and by user type?

### Why These Months?
Each monthly file has hundreds of thousands of trips, so a single month can be representative.  
I chose **March 2023** and **March 2024** to keep scope focused while allowing a true year-over-year comparison.

### Tools & Stack
**Excel** (cleaning and validation) · **Tableau** (visualization) · **Python/SQL** (planned automation)

## Data Summary

- **Source:** [Bike Share Toronto Open Data](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/bike-share-toronto-ridership-data/)
- **Months analyzed:** March 2023 and March 2024  
- **Volume:** ~537k trips combined  
- **Key fields:** Trip ID, duration, start/end stations, times, bike ID, user type  
- **2024 addition:** `Model` (bike type)  
- **Supplement:** Station reference CSV with IDs, names, and coordinates for mapping

> March vs March gives comparable seasonal conditions at high volume.

---

## Cleaning & Validation (Excel)

I used a **Data Issues Log** rather than ad-hoc fixes.

### Cleaning Steps
1. Coerced types (timestamps to datetime, duration to minutes)  
2. Dropped incomplete rows with missing start/end station or time  
3. Removed duplicates with `(start_time, end_time, bike_id)`  
4. Created `Start Hour`, `Day of Week`, `Same Station?`, `Mappable`  
5. Joined station IDs to a reference file and flagged missing IDs as **Unmapped**

### Schema Notes (2023 vs 2024)

| Field | 2023 | 2024 | Notes |
|:--|:--:|:--:|--|
| Trip Id | ✓ | ✓ | Unique per trip |
| Trip Duration (sec) | ✓ | ✓ | Converted to minutes |
| Start/End Station Id & Name | ✓ | ✓ | Some IDs updated |
| Start/End Time | ✓ | ✓ | Datetime |
| Bike Id | ✓ | ✓ |  |
| User Type | ✓ | ✓ | Annual or Casual |
| **Model (bike type)** | — | **✓** | New in 2024 |
| Derived columns | ✓ | ✓ | Created during cleaning |

> Some 2024 station IDs were not in the 2023 map file. They are kept for totals and flagged **Unmapped** for maps.

### Derived Columns

| Column | Type | How it’s computed | Why it matters |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Trip Duration (min) | Numeric | `duration_sec / 60` | Consistent time comparison |
| Start Date | Date | `date(Start Time)` | Day-level grouping |
| Start Hour | Integer | `hour(Start Time)` | Hourly patterns |
| Day of Week | Text | `weekday(Start Time)` | Weekday vs weekend |
| Same Station? | Boolean | `Start Station Id == End Station Id` | Loops vs A→B |
| Mappable | Boolean | In station reference | Map readiness |

### Data Issues (logged)

| Issue | Fix / Decision | Kept? | Example Count |
|:--|--|:--:|--:|
| End Station = NULL | Drop row | ✗ | 80 |
| Trip duration < 1 min | Drop row | ✗ | 417 |
| Trip duration > 24 hr | Drop row | ✗ | 43 |
| Start = End station | Keep, flag as Same Station | ✓ | 6,835 |
| Inconsistent station names | Standardize by ID | ✓ | 15,942 |
| Station ID missing (new) | Keep, mark **Unmapped** | ✓ | 22,000 |

## From Excel to Tableau

The two months were **unioned** and joined to the station reference. Trips with missing reference stayed in totals but were marked **Unmapped** for mapping.  
Key fields used: duration (min), hour, weekday, user type, station names, and `Model` for 2024.

## Dashboards & Insights

### 1) Overview Dashboard
![](images/OverviewDashboard.png){fig-cap="Overview: total ridership, network stats, and hourly demand (Mar 2023 and Mar 2024 combined)"}

### At a Glance
- **Total Trips:** 537,045 (both months)  
- **Avg Duration:** ~15 minutes  
- **Network Size:** 7,028 bikes across 815 stations (about 8.6 bikes per station)  
- **Annual Members:** ~21.5% share

### Usage Patterns
- Peaks at **8–9 AM** and **5–7 PM** fit office commutes  
- Midday and weekend rides are steady  
- Tuesday to Thursday is slightly higher, matching hybrid schedules

### 3) Commuter Patterns Dashboard
![](images/CommuterDashboard.png){fig-cap="Commuter Patterns: top routes by year (2023 teal, 2024 orange)"}

> Routes with a single location such as **Tommy Thompson Park** are round trips. Trips with **Unmapped** stations were excluded from route mapping.

### At a Glance
- ~**97%** of trips are point-to-point commuting  
- **Top corridors:** Union Station, Front St, Bay St, Yonge St  
- **Loop routes:** recreational trips like Tommy Thompson Park remain active  
- **2024 growth:** most high-traffic routes increased further, showing consolidation rather than fragmentation

### Interpretation
- Bike Share Toronto serves primarily **urban commuters** with consistent weekday use  
- Loop trips reflect **weekend leisure demand**  
- **Operational priority:** dock turnover and rebalancing in core corridors during peaks  
- **Marketing insight:** weekend casuals are candidates for **day-pass → subscription** funnels

> **Bottom line:** the commuter network is expanding efficiently, sustaining weekday reliability while attracting weekend explorers.

## Financial Extension — Business and Revenue Analysis

### Why a financial view?

Bike Share Toronto’s open data does not include pricing, ledger, or cost fields. To connect ridership to business outcomes, I built a simple financial layer:

- **Trip-level revenue model** using public pricing from City background files (2023/2024) and the current pricing page.  
- **Cost proxy** of **30% of revenue**, guided by NACTO’s shared micromobility benchmarks (typical range 25–35%).  
- **Transparent rules**: 2023 annual-member rides are set to $0 per trip (model type and overage billing not available). A small set of 2023 annual trips over 30 minutes (n=806) was flagged and excluded from revenue.  
- **Scope**: Membership fees, taxes, and non-operational costs are out of scope. Results are modeled estimates to illustrate direction, not accounting figures.

**What to look for below:**  
1) YoY **Revenue**, **Cost**, and **Gross Profit** KPI cards.  
2) **Revenue by day of week** to match commuter patterns.  
3) **Top 10 trips** by modeled revenue.  
4) **Bike-type split** (classic vs e-bike) and **member vs casual** contribution.

The goal is to turn usage data into a concise business readout that supports decisions on pricing, promotions, and operations.

![](images/FinancialPerformanceDashboard.png){fig-cap="Financial Performance Dashboard: Revenue, Cost (30% proxy), and Gross Profit (Mar 2023 → Mar 2024)"}

### Findings
- **Revenue:** $711,804 in Mar 2024 vs $628,748 in Mar 2023 (**+13.2%**)  
- **Cost (proxy):** $213,541 in 2024 using a 30% operating ratio  
- **Gross Profit:** $498,263 in 2024 vs $440,124 in 2023 (**+13.2%**)  
- **Weekday revenue peaks** midweek, matching commuter demand  
- **Classic bikes** generated ~94% of March 2024 revenue; e-bikes are smaller but a clear upsell

### Interpretation and Suggestions
- **Efficiency:** GP growth tracks revenue, suggesting scalable operations rather than cost inflation  
- **Demand focus:** Wednesday and Thursday are reliable cash-flow days; weekends are an opportunity for promotions or partner offers  
- **Growth play:** Most per-trip dollars come from casuals; nudge frequent casuals toward annual memberships to stabilize demand and retention

### How This Was Modeled

#### New Excel Fields
| New Field | Purpose | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Est. Trip Revenue ($)** | Calculate revenue per row | Applies the correct pricing rule by user type, duration, and bike model when available |
| **Pricing Basis** | Keep logic transparent | Label such as “Casual classic unlock + per-min” or “Member classic ≤ 30 min” |

#### Pricing Framework
![](images/Pricing_Constants.png){fig-cap="Pricing constants from City of Toronto background files, 2023 and 2024"}

| Year | User Type | Bike Type | Pricing Rule | Formula / Rate | Notes |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--|:--|:--|
| 2023 | Casual | Classic | Base 30 min | $3.25 flat | +$4 for each additional 30-min block |
| 2023 | Annual | Classic | Included | $0 per trip | Overage not identifiable in the dataset |
| 2024 | Casual | Classic | Unlock + per-min | $1 + $0.12 × minutes | 2024 model |
| 2024 | Casual | E-bike | Unlock + per-min | $1 + $0.20 × minutes | Higher e-bike rate |
| 2024 | Annual | Classic | Included + overage | MAX(0, minutes − 30) × $0.12 | Conservative |
| 2024 | Annual | E-bike | Per-min | $0.10 × minutes | Applies to all durations |

Annual member rides in 2023 were treated as **$0** because the dataset lacks overage billing and bike model detail.

#### Additional Data Issue
| Issue | Year | Count | Likely cause | Fix |
|:--|:--:|--:|--|--|
| Annual member trips > 30 min | 2023 | **806** | Overage billing not present in dataset | Excluded from revenue and noted in assumptions |

#### Cost Proxy
A **30% operating cost** ratio was applied to revenue to estimate costs. This aligns with the *NACTO 2023 Shared Micromobility Report*, which places typical cost shares in the **25–35%** range for comparable systems.
