## Overview

![](images/OverviewDashboard.png){fig-cap="Overview Dashboard: key KPIs, hourly usage, and station activity (Mar 2023 vs Mar 2024)"}

This analysis explores how **Bike Share Toronto** usage changed between **March 2023** and **March 2024**, focusing on hourly ridership, weekday vs weekend, and member vs casual mix.  
The project shows a clear workflow from **Excel cleaning** to **Tableau dashboards**, with decisions logged for transparency. The new **Financial Extension** adds a simple revenue–cost–profit view based on public pricing and documented assumptions.

## Project Purpose

### Motivation
Living in Mississauga, I rarely saw Lime scooters or shared bikes in active use. Many looked idle or abandoned mid-trip.  
That raised a question: **are these systems being used effectively, or just growing in size?**

I tried to access Lime GBFS but the process stalled, so I pivoted to **Bike Share Toronto open data**, which is clean and well structured. The work evolved into a **business-style analysis** that checks if **ridership growth** kept pace with **network expansion**.

### Core Question
> How did Bike Share Toronto usage differ between **March 2023** and **March 2024** by hour, by weekday vs weekend, and by user type?

### Why These Months?
Each monthly file has hundreds of thousands of trips, so a single month can be representative.  
I chose **March 2023** and **March 2024** to keep scope focused while allowing a true year-over-year comparison.

### Tools & Stack
**Excel** (cleaning and validation) · **Tableau** (visualization) · **Python/SQL** (planned automation)

## Data Summary

- **Source:** [Bike Share Toronto Open Data](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/bike-share-toronto-ridership-data/)
- **Months analyzed:** March 2023 and March 2024  
- **Volume:** ~537k trips combined  
- **Key fields:** Trip ID, duration, start/end stations, times, bike ID, user type  
- **2024 addition:** `Model` (bike type)  
- **Supplement:** Station reference CSV with IDs, names, and coordinates for mapping

> March vs March gives comparable seasonal conditions at high volume.

---

## Cleaning & Validation (Excel)

I used a **Data Issues Log** rather than ad-hoc fixes.

### Cleaning Steps
1. Coerced types (timestamps to datetime, duration to minutes)  
2. Dropped incomplete rows with missing start/end station or time  
3. Removed duplicates with `(start_time, end_time, bike_id)`  
4. Created `Start Hour`, `Day of Week`, `Same Station?`, `Mappable`  
5. Joined station IDs to a reference file and flagged missing IDs as **Unmapped**

### Schema Notes (2023 vs 2024)

| Field | 2023 | 2024 | Notes |
|:--|:--:|:--:|--|
| Trip Id | ✓ | ✓ | Unique per trip |
| Trip Duration (sec) | ✓ | ✓ | Converted to minutes |
| Start/End Station Id & Name | ✓ | ✓ | Some IDs updated |
| Start/End Time | ✓ | ✓ | Datetime |
| Bike Id | ✓ | ✓ |  |
| User Type | ✓ | ✓ | Annual or Casual |
| **Model (bike type)** | — | **✓** | New in 2024 |
| Derived columns | ✓ | ✓ | Created during cleaning |

> Some 2024 station IDs were not in the 2023 map file. They are kept for totals and flagged **Unmapped** for maps.

### Derived Columns

| Column | Type | How it’s computed | Why it matters |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Trip Duration (min) | Numeric | `duration_sec / 60` | Consistent time comparison |
| Start Date | Date | `date(Start Time)` | Day-level grouping |
| Start Hour | Integer | `hour(Start Time)` | Hourly patterns |
| Day of Week | Text | `weekday(Start Time)` | Weekday vs weekend |
| Same Station? | Boolean | `Start Station Id == End Station Id` | Loops vs A→B |
| Mappable | Boolean | In station reference | Map readiness |

### Data Issues (logged)

| Issue | Fix / Decision | Kept? | Example Count |
|:--|--|:--:|--:|
| End Station = NULL | Drop row | ✗ | 80 |
| Trip duration < 1 min | Drop row | ✗ | 417 |
| Trip duration > 24 hr | Drop row | ✗ | 43 |
| Start = End station | Keep, flag as Same Station | ✓ | 6,835 |
| Inconsistent station names | Standardize by ID | ✓ | 15,942 |
| Station ID missing (new) | Keep, mark **Unmapped** | ✓ | 22,000 |

---

## From Excel to Tableau

The two months were **unioned** and joined to the station reference. Trips with missing reference stayed in totals but were marked **Unmapped** for mapping.  
Key fields used: duration (min), hour, weekday, user type, station names, and `Model` for 2024.

## Dashboards & Insights

### 1) Overview Dashboard
![](images/OverviewDashboard.png){fig-cap="Overview: total ridership, network stats, and hourly demand (Mar 2023 and Mar 2024 combined)"}

### At a Glance
- **Total Trips:** 537,045 (both months)  
- **Avg Duration:** ~15 minutes  
- **Network Size:** 7,028 bikes across 815 stations (about 8.6 bikes per station)  
- **Annual Members:** ~21.5% share

### Usage Patterns
- Peaks at **8–9 AM** and **5–7 PM** fit office commutes  
- Midday and weekend rides are steady  
- Tuesday to Thursday is slightly higher, matching hybrid schedules

### Business Interpretation
- Peaks support **dock rebalancing and staffing**  
- Short average duration fits a **first/last-mile** role  
- A ~1-in-5 membership share suggests room to **convert frequent casuals**

---

### 2) Comparison Dashboard
![](images/ComparisonDashboard.png){fig-cap="Comparison: hourly and weekday trends (2023 teal vs 2024 orange)"}

### Key Observations
- **Trip Volume:** +39% (224k → 312k)  
- **Average Duration:** +12.8% (14.4 → 16.2 min)  
- **Assets:** +9% bikes and +20% stations  
- **Member Share:** −2.1 pp (22.7% → 20.6%), casuals grew faster  
- **Saturday Spread:** wider range of use, likely leisure and tourism

### Interpretation
- Supply scaled with demand, not an overcapacity story  
- Longer trips likely reflect leisure or extended routes  
- Commute peaks remain; lighter Mondays and Fridays show hybrid effects  
- More casuals in the funnel opens up retention and conversion plays

---

### 3) Commuter Patterns Dashboard
![](images/CommuterDashboard.png){fig-cap="Commuter Patterns: top routes by year (2023 teal, 2024 orange)"}

> Routes with a single location such as **Tommy Thompson Park** are round trips. Trips with **Unmapped** stations were excluded from route mapping.

### At a Glance
- ~**97%** of trips are point-to-point commuting  
- **Top corridors:** Union Station, Front St, Bay St, Yonge St  
- **Loop routes:** recreational trips like Tommy Thompson Park remain active  
- **2024 growth:** most high-traffic routes increased further, showing consolidation rather than fragmentation

### Interpretation
- Bike Share Toronto serves primarily **urban commuters** with consistent weekday use  
- Loop trips reflect **weekend leisure demand**  
- **Operational priority:** dock turnover and rebalancing in core corridors during peaks  
- **Marketing insight:** weekend casuals are candidates for **day-pass → subscription** funnels

> **Bottom line:** the commuter network is expanding efficiently, sustaining weekday reliability while attracting weekend explorers.

## Financial Extension — Business and Revenue Analysis

### Why a financial view?

Bike Share Toronto’s open data does not include pricing, membership fees, taxes, or cost information.  
To connect ridership trends to business outcomes, I added a **trip-level revenue model** using only publicly available pricing rules from the City of Toronto (2023 and 2024).

This keeps the analysis fully transparent:

- **Revenue is modeled purely at the trip level** (duration × bike model × user type)  
- **Membership fees, taxes, discounts, and account-level billing are not included**  
- **Costs and profit are not yet modeled**, because system-wide operational cost data is not available in the open dataset  
- Any cost/profit KPIs visible in the dashboard are **temporary placeholders**, included only to show what a complete financial dashboard layout could look like

I have found **official cost-per-trip figures provided by Bike Share Toronto**, which will allow a more accurate cost model.  
These will be integrated in a future update.

The financial portion of this project will remain **trip-level only**, meaning it will not include external costs such as:

- bike purchase and depreciation  
- maintenance and repairs  
- staff labour  
- rebalancing/relocation costs  
- charging infrastructure  
- administration and overhead  

Those are outside the scope of the ridership dataset, but the trip-level approach provides a realistic and defensible baseline.

### Revenue Findings (Trip-Level Only)

- **March 2023 Revenue:** $628,748  
- **March 2024 Revenue:** $711,804  
- **YoY Growth:** **+13.2%**  

Additional observations:

- Midweek (Wed/Thu) shows the strongest revenue, matching commuter behaviour  
- Classic bikes contribute ~94 percent of total revenue due to their volume  
- Casual riders generate the highest per-trip revenue and represent a strong conversion opportunity  

### Interpretation

- Ridership and revenue increased year-over-year across both commuter and leisure segments  
- Longer trip durations in 2024 suggest stronger leisure/tourism momentum  
- Casual riders remain the key source of per-trip dollars  
- Midweek revenue stability demonstrates reliable commuter demand  

> **Note:** Revenue is modeled accurately using official rate rules.  
> Cost and profit values shown in the dashboard are placeholders and will be replaced by a trip-level cost model using verified figures from Bike Share Toronto.

## How the Trip-Level Revenue Model Works

### New Excel Fields

| New Field | Purpose | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Est. Trip Revenue ($)** | Revenue per trip | Applies rate rules by year, duration, bike model, and user type |
| **Pricing Basis** | Transparency | Labels such as “2024 casual classic per-min rate” |

---

### Pricing Framework (Validated)

![](images/Pricing_Constants.png){fig-cap="Pricing constants sourced from City of Toronto background files"}

**2023 Pricing**

| User Type | Bike | Rule | Formula |
|--|--|--|--|
| Casual | Classic | Base 30 min | $3.25 flat + $4 per extra 30-min block |
| Annual | Classic | Included | $0 per trip (overage not identifiable) |

**2024 Pricing**

| User Type | Bike | Rule | Formula |
|--|--|--|--|
| Casual | Classic | Unlock + per-min | $1 + $0.12 × minutes |
| Casual | E-bike | Unlock + per-min | $1 + $0.20 × minutes |
| Annual | Classic | Overage only | MAX(0, minutes − 30) × $0.12 |
| Annual | E-bike | Per-min | $0.10 × minutes |

---

### Additional Data Issue

| Issue | Year | Count | Likely Cause | Action |
|:--|:--:|--:|--|--|
| Annual member trips > 30 minutes | 2023 | **806** | Billing data not available | Excluded from revenue (cannot be priced reliably) |

## Project Note

This financial extension is part of a **personal data analytics project**.  
It is designed to demonstrate how trip-level modeling can be applied to an open mobility dataset.  
The financial section is intentionally limited to fields available in the data.  
A refined version with verified cost-per-trip values will be published soon.
