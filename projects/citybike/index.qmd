## Summary

**Question.** For a quick, scoped snapshot: *How did Bike Share Toronto usage differ between **March 2023** and **March 2024**, and when/where are the peaks most pronounced?*

**Why these months?** March alone already has **~500k+ trips** across the two yearsâ€”enough to expose hourly/weekday patterns without boiling the ocean. Iâ€™ll scale the scope later.

**Stack.** Excel (cleaning/validation) Â· Tableau (dashboard) Â· Python/SQL (planned)

---

## Data & Scope

- **Source:** Bike Share Toronto open data (Trips for **Mar 2023** and **Mar 2024**)
- **Core fields:** start time/end time, station names/IDs, trip duration, member type
- **Scope choice:** one month per year to keep season similar yet volume high

> *Planned extension:* add adjacent months to test before/after effects of downtown **e-scooter restrictions** (with citation).

## Cleaning Workflow (Excel)

**Goals:** fix types, remove duplicates, handle nulls, and create analysis-ready columns.

**Steps I took**
1. **Type fixes:** coerced timestamps to datetime; durations to numeric minutes  
2. **Null handling:** filtered rows with missing station IDs/time; documented counts  
3. **De-duplication:** removed duplicates by `(start_time, end_time, bike_id)`  
4. **Derived columns:** `hour_of_day`, `weekday`, `is_member`  
5. **Data issues log:** tracked anomalies (e.g., negative durations, midnight spikes)

## Findings (So Far)

- **Peak hours:** weekday **17:00â€“18:00** strongest; **7â€“9 AM** morning commute visible  
- **Member mix:** change in **annual member %** year-over-year (quantify after KPI lock)  
- **Hotspots:** downtown core stations dominate activity  
- **2023 â†’ 2024:** peak intensity appears higher in 2024 (confirm with final totals)

> **Limits:** single month per year; weather unaccounted; no promo/fare context

## Whatâ€™s Next

1. **Comparison dashboard** (Mar 2023 vs Mar 2024 KPIs side-by-side)  
2. **E-scooter policy check** with surrounding months (before/after) + citation  
3. **Python/SQL pipeline** for reproducible cleaning & station-hour aggregations  
4. **Predictive baseline:** simple hourly demand regression for top 10 stations

## Repro Notes

- **Assumptions:** local timezone; station names normalized by ID where possible  
- **Files referenced:** `data_issues.xlsx` (in this project folder), screenshots under `/images/`  
- **Contact:** Feedback welcomeâ€”this will expand into a broader 2024 view + policy checks
