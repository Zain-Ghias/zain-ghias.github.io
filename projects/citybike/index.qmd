## Summary

**Question.** For a scoped snapshot: *How did Bike Share Toronto usage differ between **March 2023** and **March 2024**—by hour and weekday/weekend—and what changed in the member/casual mix?*

**Why these months?** March alone already has ~**500k+** trips across the two years—enough to reveal strong hourly patterns without boiling the ocean. I’ll scale the scope later.

**Why I’m doing this.** I’ve been seeing micromobility (bikes/scooters) all over Mississauga—often parked, sometimes deserted—and got curious about **real usage** and adoption. This project is my way to quantify it: start tight (two months), then expand into comparisons, models, and policy context (e-scooter restrictions).

**Stack.** Excel (cleaning/validation) · Tableau (dashboard) · Python/SQL (planned)

---

## Data & Scope

- **Source:** Bike Share Toronto open data (Trips for **Mar 2023** and **Mar 2024**)
- **Core fields:** Trip Id, duration, start/end times, station IDs/names, bike ID, user type  
- **Scope choice:** one month per year to keep season similar yet volume high

> *Planned extension:* add adjacent months to test before/after effects of downtown **e-scooter restrictions** (with citation).

## Excel Cleaning & Validation

I validated and cleaned both months with a reproducible **Data_issues** log rather than ad-hoc fixes.

**Goals:** fix types, remove duplicates, handle nulls, and create analysis-ready columns.

### Steps I took
1. **Type fixes:** coerced timestamps to datetime; durations to numeric minutes  
2. **Null handling:** filtered rows with missing station IDs/time; documented counts  
3. **De-duplication:** removed duplicates by `(start_time, end_time, bike_id)`  
4. **Derived columns:** `Trip Duration (min)`, `Start Date`, `Start Hour`, `Day of Week`, `Same Station?`, `Mappable`  
5. **Data issues log:** tracked anomalies (e.g., negative durations, unmapped station IDs)

### Schema Notes (2023 vs 2024)

| Field                                | 2023 | 2024 | Notes |
|---|:---:|:---:|---|
| Trip Id                              | ✓ | ✓ | unique per ride |
| Trip Duration (sec)                  | ✓ | ✓ | converted to minutes for visuals |
| Start/End Station Id & Name          | ✓ | ✓ | some IDs had outdated names |
| Start/End Time                       | ✓ | ✓ | coerced to datetime |
| Bike Id                              | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| User Type                            | ✓ | ✓ | Annual / Casual |
| **Model** (bike type)                | — | **✓** | **New in 2024** |
| Derived: Duration (min), Start Date, Start Hour, Day of Week, Same Station?, Mappable | ✓ | ✓ | created during cleaning |

> **Stations reference:** I found an **older stations file** with lat/longs. Newer station IDs (2023/2024) weren’t all present, so I flagged those trips as **Unmapped** (kept for totals, excluded from maps as needed).

### Derived Columns

| Column                 | Type     | How it’s computed                      | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Trip Duration (min)`  | numeric  | `duration_sec / 60` (rounded)          | consistent comparisons |
| `Start Date`           | date     | `date(Start Time)`                      | daily grouping |
| `Start Hour`           | integer  | `hour(Start Time)`                      | peak-hour analysis |
| `Day of Week`          | text     | `weekday(Start Time)`                   | weekday vs weekend |
| `Same Station?`        | boolean  | `Start Station Id == End Station Id`    | loops/returns |
| `Mappable`             | boolean  | station ID present in reference file    | map readiness |

### Data Issues (logged)

Counted, decisioned, then fixed/flagged; repeated for **Mar 2024** (with the extra `Model` field).

| Issue                                   | Fix / Decision                               | Kept? | Count (example) |
|---|---|:---:|---:|
| `End Station = NULL`                    | drop rows (incomplete)                        | ✗ | 80 |
| Trip duration `< 1 min`                 | drop (unlock/return test)                     | ✗ | 417 |
| Trip duration `> 24 hr`                 | drop (logging error)                          | ✗ | 43 |
| Start station = End station             | keep, flagged in `Same Station?`              | ✓ | 6,835 |
| Duplicate Trip Ids                      | keep first, remove duplicates                  | ✓ | 0 |
| Inconsistent station names (ID present) | standardize name via ID                       | ✓ | 15,942 |
| Station ID not in reference (new IDs)   | keep trip, mark as **Unmapped**               | ✓ | 22,000 |

## From Excel → Tableau (Data Model)

After cleaning, I imported both months into **Tableau**.

- **Union:** Mar-2023 and Mar-2024 trip tables combined; added metadata (Year, Month).  
- **Join:** Station reference (ID → lat/long/name) for mapping; rows with missing reference flagged as **Unmapped**.  
- **Fields used:** duration (min), hour, weekday, member type, station IDs/names, `Model` (2024 only).  
- **Visuals built:** overview KPIs, Trips-by-Hour, weekday heatmap, and station map.  
- **Next build:** a **comparison dashboard** (side-by-side 2023 vs 2024).

## Findings (So Far)

- **Peak hours (weekdays):** clear commute peaks at **8–9 AM** and **5–7 PM**.  
- **Weekends:** usage is broader and more distributed (**~11 AM–7 PM**), with no sharp single peak.  
- **Member mix:** overall across the two months ≈ **21.5% members**; the **YoY change is small** (≈≤ **2 percentage points** from Mar-2023 → Mar-2024).  
- **Ridership growth:** total rides are **higher in 2024**, so general usage is up.  
- **Routes:** many **round trips** appear among top routes—likely loops/non-commute behavior (e.g., short errands, deliveries).

> **Limits:** single month per year; weather not controlled; station reference partially outdated; promotions/policy context not yet incorporated.

## What’s Next

1. **Comparison dashboard:** KPIs and distributions (Mar-2023 vs Mar-2024) side-by-side.  
2. **2024 model usage:** which **bike model** is most used, and by when/where?  
3. **Top routes (commute focus):** analyze flows **excluding round trips** to better isolate commuting.  
4. **Policy check:** add months around the **e-scooter restriction** date to test for a measurable **before/after** effect.  
5. **Python/SQL pipeline:** reproducible cleaning and station-hour aggregations.  
6. **Predictive baseline:** simple hourly demand model for top stations (limitations documented).

## Repro Notes

- **Assumptions:** local timezone; station names normalized by ID when possible.  
- **Files referenced:** `data_issues.xlsx` (this project), screenshots under `/images/`.  
- **Notes on mapping:** trips with unknown/new station IDs are kept but flagged **Unmapped** to avoid dropping real rides.
