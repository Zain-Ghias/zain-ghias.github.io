## Summary

**Question.** For a scoped snapshot: *How did Bike Share Toronto usage differ between **March 2023** and **March 2024**, and when/where are the peaks most pronounced?*  

**Why these months?** March alone already has **~500k+ trips** across the two years—enough to expose hourly/weekday patterns without drowning in volume. I’ll scale later.  

**Stack.** Excel (cleaning/validation) · Tableau (dashboard) · Python/SQL (planned)  

---

## Data & Scope

- **Source:** Bike Share Toronto open data (Trips for **Mar 2023** and **Mar 2024**)  
- **Core fields:** Trip Id, duration, start/end times, station IDs/names, bike ID, user type  
- **Scope choice:** one month per year to keep season similar yet volume high  

> *Planned extension:* add adjacent months to test before/after effects of downtown **e-scooter restrictions** (with citation).

---

## Cleaning Workflow (Excel)

I used Excel to validate and clean both months systematically, with a reproducible **Data_issues log**.  

**Goals:** fix types, remove duplicates, handle nulls, create analysis-ready columns.  

### Steps I took
1. **Type fixes:** coerced timestamps to datetime; durations to numeric minutes  
2. **Null handling:** filtered rows with missing station IDs/time; documented counts  
3. **De-duplication:** removed duplicates by `(start_time, end_time, bike_id)`  
4. **Derived columns:** `Trip Duration (min)`, `Start Date`, `Start Hour`, `Day of Week`, `Same Station?`, `Mappable`  
5. **Data issues log:** tracked anomalies (e.g., negative durations, unmapped station IDs)

### Schema Notes (2023 vs 2024)

| Field                                | 2023 | 2024 | Notes |
|---|:---:|:---:|---|
| Trip Id                              | ✓ | ✓ | unique per ride |
| Trip Duration (sec)                  | ✓ | ✓ | converted to minutes for visuals |
| Start/End Station Id & Name          | ✓ | ✓ | some IDs had outdated names |
| Start/End Time                       | ✓ | ✓ | coerced to datetime |
| Bike Id                              | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| User Type                            | ✓ | ✓ | Annual / Casual |
| **Model** (bike type)                | — | **✓** | **New in 2024** |
| Derived: Duration (min), Start Date, Start Hour, Day of Week, Same Station?, Mappable | ✓ | ✓ | created during cleaning |

> **Stations reference:** I found an **older stations file** with lat/longs. Many new station IDs (2023/2024) weren’t in it, so I flagged them as **Unmapped** instead of dropping valid trips.

### Derived Columns

| Column              | Type     | How it’s computed                                | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Trip Duration (min)` | numeric  | `duration_sec / 60` (rounded)                    | consistent comparisons |
| `Start Date`        | date     | `date(Start Time)`                                | daily grouping |
| `Start Hour`        | integer  | `hour(Start Time)`                                | peak-hour analysis |
| `Day of Week`       | text     | `weekday(Start Time)`                             | weekday vs weekend |
| `Same Station?`     | boolean  | `Start Station Id == End Station Id`              | short loops / returns |
| `Mappable`          | boolean  | station ID present in reference file              | map readiness |

### Data Issues (logged)

Each issue was counted, decisioned, and either fixed or flagged. I repeated the pass for **Mar 2024** (with the extra `Model` field).

| Issue                                   | Fix / Decision                                 | Kept? | Count (example) |
|---|---|:---:|---:|
| `End Station = NULL`                    | drop rows (incomplete)                          | ✗ | 80 |
| Trip duration `< 1 min`                 | drop (unlock/return test)                       | ✗ | 417 |
| Trip duration `> 24 hr`                 | drop (logging error)                            | ✗ | 43 |
| Start station = End station             | keep, flagged in `Same Station?`                | ✓ | 6,835 |
| Duplicate Trip Ids                      | keep first, remove duplicates                    | ✓ | 0 |
| Inconsistent station names (ID present) | standardize name via ID                         | ✓ | 15,942 |
| Station ID not in reference (new IDs)   | keep trip, mark as Unmapped                     | ✓ | 22,000 |

## Findings (So Far)

- **Peak hours:** weekday **17:00–18:00** strongest; **7–9 AM** morning commute visible  
- **Member mix:** Annual vs Casual share shifts year-to-year  
- **Hotspots:** downtown core stations dominate activity  
- **2023 → 2024:** peak intensity appears higher in 2024 (needs KPI confirmation)  

> **Limits:** single month per year; weather unaccounted; no promo/fare context

---

## What’s Next

1. **Comparison dashboard** (Mar 2023 vs Mar 2024 KPIs side-by-side)  
2. **E-scooter policy check** with surrounding months (before/after) + citation  
3. **Python/SQL pipeline** for reproducible cleaning & station-hour aggregations  
4. **Predictive baseline:** simple hourly demand regression for top 10 stations

## Repro Notes

- **Assumptions:** local timezone; station names normalized by ID where possible  
- **Files referenced:** `data_issues.xlsx` (in this project folder), screenshots under `/images/`  
- **Contact:** Feedback welcome—this will expand into a broader 2024 view + policy checks
