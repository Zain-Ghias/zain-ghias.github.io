Analyzing Customer Spending Habits
_________________________________________________________________________________________________


Total revenue is ~$12.9M, with overall profit of ~$1.3M and a 13.37% average profit margin across 18,432 transactions.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________


| Category    | Revenue   | Profit  | Avg Margin | Units Sold |
| ----------- | --------- | ------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Accessories | 3,965,546 | 740,630 | 17.23%     | 22,873     |
| Clothing    | 1,909,173 | 304,852 | 14.80%     | 5,692      |
| Bikes       | 7,062,327 | 257,559 | 1.49%      | 8,240      |


⭐ Key Insights (Use these in your Quarto report)
1. Accessories is the most profitable category

Generates 740k profit — the highest among all categories

Strong 17.23% average profit margin

Makes less revenue than Bikes, but margins are far better

Likely high-margin accessories (e.g., tools, apparel, add-ons)

2. Clothing is mid-tier

~305k total profit

Margin 14.8%, stable and healthy

Lower volume, but good contribution

3. Bikes generate the most revenue but lowest profit

$7.06M revenue (highest)

Only $257k profit

Margin 1.49% → extremely low

Indicates:

high manufacturing cost

aggressive pricing

promotions/discounting

possibly competitive market pressure

4. Strategic Interpretation

Accessories & Clothing → high-margin cash generators

Bikes → loss leader / low-margin category, drives volume but not profit

This is a VERY realistic pattern in retail & manufacturing datasets.

⭐ Short Version (for your interview)

If someone asks what you found:

“Accessories and Clothing contribute the majority of profit due to higher margins, while Bikes generate the highest revenue but have very thin margins (around 1.5%), indicating a volume-driven but low-margin category.”

Perfect. Clean. Shows business understanding.

SQL Insight — Top 15 Most Profitable Sub-Categories

| Sub-Category    | Revenue   | Profit     | Avg Margin |
| --------------- | --------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Helmets         | 1,438,293 | 272,057.67 | 17.27%     |
| Tires and Tubes | 1,361,888 | 244,189.11 | 16.80%     |
| Jerseys         | 1,014,103 | 165,593.14 | 14.45%     |
| Mountain Bikes  | 4,020,915 | 129,768.15 | 1.44%      |
| Bottles & Cages | 377,929   | 70,565.48  | 17.24%     |
| Touring Bikes   | 935,282   | 65,685.5   | 4.49%      |
| Fenders         | 300,787   | 63,832.19  | 20.35%     |
| Road Bikes      | 2,106,130 | 62,105.51  | 0.61%      |
| Shorts          | 390,164   | 52,134.05  | 12.23%     |
| Hydration Packs | 265,017   | 45,237.02  | 15.60%     |
| Vests           | 220,398   | 34,838.94  | 14.08%     |
| Gloves          | 110,139   | 23,674.03  | 20.18%     |
| Caps            | 140,652   | 23,499     | 15.25%     |
| Bike Racks      | 98,139    | 21,893     | 22.68%     |
| Bike Stands     | 83,539    | 14,374     | 17.08%     |


⭐ Key Insights (Summarize These in Your Portfolio)
1. Helmets, Tires & Tubes, and Jerseys dominate profitability

These three categories lead profit generation:

High margins (14%–17%)

Strong demand

Low production costs (esp. Helmets & Tires)

High accessory sales volume

These align perfectly with real-world cycling/accessory retail economics.

2. Accessories outperform Bikes massively in profit

Even though Bikes generate more revenue, Bikes:

Have very low margins (1%–4%)

Are expensive to manufacture

Often sold with discounts

Face intense competition

Sub-categories like:

Fenders (20.35% margin)

Gloves (20.18% margin)

Bike Racks (22.68% margin)

…are the true profit drivers.

This is a realistic pattern in retail:
Accessories = high margin. Bikes = high volume.

3. Mountain Bikes have high revenue but extremely low profit

$4M+ revenue

Only $129k profit

Margin ~1.44%

This is a GREAT talking point during your interview:

“High-ticket items can still have razor-thin margins due to competitive pricing, manufacturing costs, or promotional strategies.”

4. Road Bikes are even worse (0.61% margin)

This is your BEST insight so far because it’s counterintuitive:

$2.1M revenue

Profit only ~62k

Margin 0.61%

This indicates:

price pressure

heavy discounts

higher-than-expected costs

5. The highest-margin sub-categories are niche accessories

Profit margin leaders:

Bike Racks — 22.68%

Fenders — 20.35%

Gloves — 20.18%

These small-ticket items are extremely profitable.

This is EXACTLY the kind of insight Kohler expects an analyst intern to discover.

⭐ Short Version (for interview answer)

Use this if asked:

“The most profitable sub-categories were Helmets, Tires & Tubes, and Jerseys, each generating strong margins above 14%. Meanwhile, high-revenue Bike categories — like Mountain and Road Bikes — surprisingly had very low margins (1–2%). This suggests accessories drive profitability, while bikes drive volume. It’s a classic retail pattern: high-ticket items draw customers, but accessories generate profit.”

This answer makes you look like a business-oriented data analyst, not just someone who ran SQL.

SQL Insight — Top 4 Countries by Revenue & Profit

| Country            | Revenue   | Profit     | Avg Margin | Transactions |
| ------------------ | --------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| **Germany**        | 2,632,623 | 577,345.26 | **26.37%** | 2,837        |
| **United States**  | 5,266,789 | 375,840.40 | **11.36%** | 8,871        |
| **United Kingdom** | 2,840,082 | 210,084.20 | **12.10%** | 3,826        |
| **France**         | 2,197,552 | 139,771.93 | **8.49%**  | 2,898        |


⭐ Key Insights (You’ll use these in your Quarto write-up)
1. Germany has the highest profit AND the strongest margins

Even though Germany has fewer transactions than the US, it produces:

$577k profit (highest)

26.37% average margin (highest)

This suggests:

Premium product mix (more accessories, high-margin items)

Less discounting

Possibly higher retail prices or stronger brand loyalty

This is a very mature insight.

2. The United States leads in total revenue but not profit

The US has:

$5.26M revenue (highest)

8,871 transactions (highest)

But only $375k profit

Margin just 11.36%, less than half of Germany

Interpretation:

US shoppers buy more high-ticket, low-margin items (like bikes)

Heavy promotions / competitive pricing reduce margins

Larger volume does not equal larger profitability

🔥 Amazing insight to mention verbally during interviews.

3. United Kingdom has healthy profitability

$210k profit

12.1% margin (much stronger than France)

Likely a balanced mix of:

mid-range bikes

apparel

accessories

4. France has the lowest margin among top countries

8.49% average margin

Despite over $2.19M revenue

Possible explanations:

more discounting

weaker accessory sales

more price sensitivity

different competitive environment

This is real-world analytics thinking.

⭐ Good 2–3 Sentence Summary (Use This in Your Portfolio)

“Germany emerged as the most profitable market with a 26% margin, despite having fewer transactions than the US. The United States drove the highest revenue and volume, but profit margins were significantly lower (11%), suggesting heavier discounting or a product mix skewed toward low-margin categories. The UK and France showed moderate performance, with France having the weakest margin among the top markets.”

Germany has several strong mid-tier states with steady margins.
