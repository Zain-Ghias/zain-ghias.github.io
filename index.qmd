Hi, I'm **Zain**,  

a third-year student at the **University of Toronto Mississauga**, majoring in **Applied Statistics** with minors in **Computer Science** and **Math**.  

I'm currently working as a **Software Developer Intern** at a startup, but I'm shifting my focus toward **Data Analytics**, **Data Science**, and exploring areas like **AI** and **Machine Learning**. I'm planning to take more ML and stats courses next year, and I'm open to getting involved in research if it's in something exciting or meaningful.  

I like **volleyball**, **table tennis**, and **basketball**, and I try to balance screen time with touching grass and going on long walks, partly for my sanity.  

Thanks for stopping by. Excited to see where this journey goes.

**Get in touch:** [zain.ghias@mail.utoronto.ca](mailto:zain.ghias@mail.utoronto.ca)
