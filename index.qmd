Hi, I'm **Zain**,  

a third-year **Applied Statistics** student at the **University of Toronto Mississauga**, with minors in **Computer Science** and **Mathematics**.  

I'm currently a **Software Engineer Intern** at **Wholeviz**, a data visualization platform that helps NGOs, journalists, and public teams build interactive dashboards. My work focuses on **React**, **Next.js**, **Tailwind**, and **Plotly**, where I‚Äôve been learning to merge design, data, and storytelling to make information more usable.  

Previously, I worked at **Quor**, a Toronto startup, as a **Frontend Developer Intern**, helping design and build a cross-platform mobile app in **React Native**. Those startup experiences taught me to be adaptable ‚Äî to pick up new tools on the fly and figure things out as I go.  

Lately, I‚Äôve been expanding into **data analytics** and **business analysis**, combining my statistics background with technical skills to uncover trends and communicate insights. I‚Äôm also exploring **machine learning** and **data visualization**, aiming to bridge the gap between analysis and product decisions.  

Outside of code and coursework, I try to stay grounded ‚Äî literally. I like **volleyball**, **table tennis**, and long walks around Mississauga to balance the screen time (and touch grass for my sanity).  

I‚Äôm naturally curious about how things work ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs a dataset, a business model, or a React component ‚Äî and I enjoy translating that curiosity into projects that make data actually mean something.
