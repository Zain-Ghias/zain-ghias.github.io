## About Me

Hi, I'm **Zain**, a third-year **Applied Statistics** student at the **University of Toronto Mississauga**, with minors in **Computer Science** and **Mathematics**.  

I'm passionate about connecting **data, design, and storytelling** by using analysis and visualization to make information more human and useful.

### Current Work

I'm currently a **Software Engineer Intern** at **Wholeviz**, a data visualization platform helping NGOs, journalists, and public teams turn datasets into interactive dashboards. My work focuses on **React**, **Next.js**, **Tailwind**, and **Plotly**, where I design intuitive front-end interfaces and experiment with **AI-assisted data visualization** features like automated chart generation and data-cleaning helpers.

Recently, I was selected for the **Skills for the Future Program** with **IBM SkillsBuild × Riipen**, where I'm collaborating with **Digital Placemaking Canada**, a predictive intelligence startup that models and forecasts group behaviors in real-world spaces. I'm contributing to the **website redesign** and working on **data-driven dashboards** that visualize behavioral insights and community engagement in clearer, more actionable ways.

My experience working at startups has taught me to be adaptable, communicate effectively across different teams, and deliver results in fast-paced environments.

### Learning & Growth

Alongside that, I'm completing the **IBM Data Analytics Professional Certificate** on Coursera and the **IBM SkillsBuild Digital Credential in User Experience Design Fundamentals**.  

Through these programs, I'm deepening my skills in **Excel, SQL, Python (Pandas)**, and **IBM Cognos Analytics**, while learning to bridge **analytical storytelling** with **UI and UX design thinking**.

### Beyond the Screen

Outside of code and coursework, I recharge through **volleyball**, **table tennis**, and long walks around Mississauga.  

I'm naturally curious about how things work, whether that's a dataset, a business model, or a React component, and I like turning that curiosity into projects that make data actually mean something.
