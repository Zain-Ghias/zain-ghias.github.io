All cleaning and metric engineering was completed in **MySQL** using structured SQL scripts.\n\n### Transformation Steps\n\n1. **Standardized column names** — converted spaces to underscores for SQL compatibility  \n2. **Date conversion** — transformed text-based dates (`MM/DD/YY`) into proper `DATE` type  \n3. **Metric engineering** — calculated `Profit` and `Profit_Margin` at the transaction level  \n4. **Data validation** — ran checks for nulls, negative values, and revenue calculation mismatches\n\n### SQL Transformation Script\n\nThe complete transformation script is available in `sql/transformations.sql`. Key steps include:\n\n```sql\n-- Standardize column names\nALTER TABLE sales_transactions\nCHANGE COLUMN `Customer Age` Customer_Age INT,\nCHANGE COLUMN `Customer Gender` Customer_Gender VARCHAR(10),\nCHANGE COLUMN `Product Category` Product_Category VARCHAR(50),\nCHANGE COLUMN `Sub Category` Sub_Category VARCHAR(50);\n\n-- Convert text dates to DATE type\nUPDATE sales_transactions\nSET Date_Formatted = STR_TO_DATE(Date, '%m/%d/%y');\n\n-- Add derived business metrics\nUPDATE sales_transactions\nSET Profit = (Unit_Price - Unit_Cost) * Quantity,\n    Profit_Margin = ROUND(Profit / Revenue * 100, 2);\n```\n\n**Key transformations:**\n- Column name standardization (e.g., `Customer Age` → `Customer_Age`)\n- Date parsing using `STR_TO_DATE()` with format `'%m/%d/%y'`\n- Profit calculation: `(Unit_Price - Unit_Cost) * Quantity`\n- Profit margin: `(Profit / Revenue) * 100`\n\n---\n\n## Exploratory Analysis (SQL)\n\nAfter transformation, exploratory queries were run to understand profitability patterns, validate data quality, and prepare insights for visualization.\n\n### Analysis Queries\n\n```{sql}\n#| file: sql/analysis_queries.sql\n```\n\n**Analysis covered:**\n- Executive summary metrics (total revenue, profit, margin)\n- Product category and sub-category profitability\n- Regional performance (country and state level)\n- Monthly revenue and profit trends\n- Customer segmentation by age and gender\n- Margin analysis across product lines\n\n---\n\n## Key SQL Findings\n\n### Executive Summary\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|:--|--:|\n| **Total Revenue** | $12.94M |\n| **Total Profit** | $1.30M |\n| **Average Profit Margin** | 13.37% |\n| **Total Units Sold** | 36,805 |\n| **Total Transactions** | 18,432 |\n\n---\n\n### Profitability by Product Category\n\n| Category | Revenue | Profit | Avg Margin | Units Sold |\n|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|\n| **Accessories** | $3.97M | $740,630 | **17.23%** | 22,873 |\n| **Clothing** | $1.91M | $304,852 | **14.80%** | 5,692 |\n| **Bikes** | $7.06M | $257,559 | **1.49%** | 8,240 |\n\n**Insights:**\n- **Accessories & Clothing** drive the majority of profit due to strong margins (17% and 15% respectively)\n- **Bikes** generate the highest revenue ($7M+) but deliver **extremely low margin (~1.5%)**\n- This is a classic retail pattern: **high-ticket items = low margin; accessories = high margin**\n\n---\n\n### Most Profitable Sub-Categories (Top 15)\n\n| Sub-Category | Revenue | Profit | Avg Margin |\n|:--|--:|--:|--:|\n| **Helmets** | $1.44M | $272,058 | 17.27% |\n| **Tires and Tubes** | $1.36M | $244,189 | 16.80% |\n| **Jerseys** | $1.01M | $165,593 | 14.45% |\n| **Mountain Bikes** | $4.02M | $129,768 | 1.44% |\n| **Bottles & Cages** | $377,929 | $70,565 | 17.24% |\n| **Touring Bikes** | $935,282 | $65,686 | 4.49% |\n| **Fenders** | $300,787 | $63,832 | **20.35%** |\n| **Road Bikes** | $2.11M | $62,106 | **0.61%** |\n| **Shorts** | $390,164 | $52,134 | 12.23% |\n| **Hydration Packs** | $265,017 | $45,237 | 15.60% |\n| **Vests** | $220,398 | $34,839 | 14.08% |\n| **Gloves** | $110,139 | $23,674 | **20.18%** |\n| **Caps** | $140,652 | $23,499 | 15.25% |\n| **Bike Racks** | $98,139 | $21,893 | **22.68%** |\n| **Bike Stands** | $83,539 | $14,374 | 17.08% |\n\n**Key observations:**\n- **Helmets, Tires & Tubes, and Jerseys** dominate profit generation with strong margins (14–17%)\n- **High-margin accessories** like Fenders (20.35%), Gloves (20.18%), and Bike Racks (22.68%) are the true profit drivers\n- **Mountain Bikes** generate $4M+ revenue but only $130k profit (1.44% margin)\n- **Road Bikes** show the lowest margin at **0.61%** despite $2.1M revenue — indicating heavy price pressure or cost issues\n\n---\n\n### Regional Performance\n\n| Country | Revenue | Profit | Avg Margin | Transactions |\n|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|\n| **Germany** | $2.63M | $577,345 | **26.37%** | 2,837 |\n| **United States** | $5.27M | $375,840 | 11.36% | 8,871 |\n| **United Kingdom** | $2.84M | $210,084 | 12.10% | 3,826 |\n| **France** | $2.20M | $139,772 | 8.49% | 2,898 |\n\n**Insights:**\n- **Germany** is the most profitable market with the strongest margins (26.37%) despite fewer transactions\n- **United States** leads in revenue and volume but has significantly lower margins (11.36%), suggesting heavier discounting or a product mix skewed toward low-margin categories\n- **France** shows the weakest margin performance (8.49%) among top markets\n\n---\n\n### Monthly Revenue & Profit Trends\n\n**Key patterns:**\n- **Strong seasonal lift** from Q3–Q4 2015 through Q1–Q2 2016\n- **December 2015** peak: $1.19M revenue, $37k profit\n- **2016 Q1–Q2** shows much stronger performance than 2015 — clear year-over-year growth\n- **Early 2015** includes several months with negative profit margins, flipping positive mid-year\n\n| Year | Month | Revenue | Profit |\n|:--|:--|--:|--:|\n| 2015 | July | $484,449 | $8,978 |\n| 2015 | August | $705,931 | $40,267 |\n| 2015 | December | $1,196,429 | $37,447 |\n| 2016 | January | $1,016,294 | $162,339 |\n| 2016 | June | $1,359,297 | $215,844 |\n\n---\n\n### Customer Segmentation Insights\n\n**Revenue by Age:**\n- **Ages 28–31** drive the highest revenue (core buyer segment)\n- Revenue remains strong across **late 30s–early 40s**, suggesting mature customers also spend heavily\n- Very young (18–23) and very old (60+) ages contribute minimal revenue\n\n**Top revenue-generating ages:** 28 ($563k), 31 ($523k), 29 ($513k), 40 ($480k), 30 ($477k)\n\n---\n\n##
