    "section": "Project Purpose",
    "text": "Project Purpose\n\nMotivation\nLiving in Mississauga, I rarely saw Lime scooters or shared bikes being actively used — most were either idle or even abandoned mid-trip across sidewalks and plazas.\nThat made me wonder: are these systems truly being used, or just expanding in size?\nI initially reached out to Lime to access their GBFS (live feed) data, but since the process stalled, I pivoted to Bike Share Toronto’s open data, which offered a cleaner and more structured source. This curiosity evolved into a business-style analysis — exploring whether ridership growth actually kept pace with network expansion.\n\n\nCore Question\n\nHow did Bike Share Toronto usage differ between March 2023 and March 2024 — by hour, by weekday/weekend, and by user type?\n\n\n\nWhy These Months?\nDuring exploration, I noticed that each monthly dataset contained hundreds of thousands of trip records, making it both rich and representative.\nRather than “boiling the ocean,” I chose March 2023 and March 2024 — two directly comparable early-season months — to strike a balance between depth and focus.\nThis allowed for a manageable yet statistically meaningful comparison that reveals clear year-over-year patterns.\n\n\nTools & Stack\nExcel (cleaning & validation) · Tableau (visualization) · Python/SQL (planned automation)"

    "text": "Dashboards & Insights\n\n1) Overview Dashboard\n\n\nAt a Glance\n\nTotal Trips: 537,045 (both months) — strong early-season performance.\n\nAvg Duration: 15 minutes — short urban trips, mainly commuting or errands.\n\nNetwork Size: 7,028 bikes across 815 stations → 8.6 bikes per station, a healthy density.\n\nAnnual Members: 21.5% — casual users still dominate, potential for membership growth.\n\n\n\nUsage Patterns\n\nPeaks: 8–9 AM & 5–7 PM, consistent with office commutes.\n\nMidday/Weekend Rides: steady, pointing to errands and recreation.\n\nTues–Thurs activity slightly higher — aligns with hybrid work schedules (in-office midweek).\n\n\n\nBusiness Interpretation\n\nPredictable AM/PM peaks allow for dock rebalancing and resource planning.\n\nThe short average trip duration confirms the system’s role as a first/last-mile link in city transport.\n\nThe 1-in-5 membership ratio shows room to convert frequent casuals through commuter promotions or referral discounts.\n\n\nOverall: Bike Share Toronto shows strong system utilization and clear commuter dependence — valuable for both planners and operators.\n\n\n\n\n\n2) Comparison Dashboard\n\n\nKey Observations\n\nTrip Volume: +39% (224K → 312K)\n\nAverage Duration: +12.8% (14.4 → 16.2 min) → longer trips, likely casual/leisure.\n\nBikes/Stations: +9% bikes, +20% stations — expansion aligned with demand.\n\nMember Share: ↓ 2.1 pp (22.7% → 20.6%) → casual segment grew faster.\n\nSaturday Spread: wider use range, suggesting leisure/tourism component.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\nGrowth Quality: Supply (stations, bikes) scaled with usage → no overcapacity issue.\n\nTrip Duration: Longer rides reflect new routes, leisure use, or extended trips rather than inefficiency.\n\nCommute Peaks: 8–9 AM, 5–7 PM still dominate; lighter Mondays/Fridays show hybrid work impact.\n\nMembership Mix: Drop in member ratio = more casual users entering funnel → marketing can aim to retain & convert these.\n\n\nIn summary: March 2024 brought both scale and diversity — a broader, more active user base beyond just commuters.\n\n\n\n\n\n3) Commuter Patterns Dashboard\n\n\nNote: Routes showing only one location (e.g., Tommy Thompson Park) are round trips — users start and end at the same station, often for recreation. Trips with unmapped stations were excluded to ensure accuracy.\n\n\nAt a Glance\n\n~97% of trips = point-to-point commuting.\n\nTop Corridors: Union Station, Front St, Bay St, and Yonge St remain high-volume anchors.\n\nLoop Routes: Recreational trips like Tommy Thompson Park still see heavy activity.\n\n2024 Growth: Most high-traffic routes increased further — showing consolidation, not fragmentation.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\nBike Share Toronto serves primarily urban commuters, with consistent weekday use.\n\nLoop trips reflect weekend leisure demand, balancing functional and recreational users.\n\nOperational priority: focus on dock turnover & rebalancing in core corridors during peaks.\n\nMarketing insight: casual weekend users could be encouraged to join membership tiers through day-pass → subscription funnels.\n\n\nBottom line: The commuter network is expanding efficiently — sustaining weekday reliability while attracting weekend explorers."

My work focuses on React, Next.js, Tailwind, and Plotly, where I’ve been learning to merge design, data, and storytelling to make information more usable.\nPreviously, I worked at Quor, a Toronto startup, as a Frontend Developer Intern, helping design and build a cross-platform mobile app in React Native. Those startup experiences taught me to be adaptable — to pick up new tools on the fly and figure things out as I go.\nLately, I’ve been expanding into data analytics and business analysis, combining my statistics background with technical skills to uncover trends and communicate insights. I’m also exploring machine learning and data visualization, aiming to bridge the gap between analysis and product decisions.\nOutside of code and coursework, I try to stay grounded — literally. I like volleyball, table tennis, and long walks around Mississauga to balance the screen time (and touch grass for my sanity).\nI’m naturally curious about how things work — whether it’s a dataset, a business model, or a React component — and I enjoy translating that curiosity into projects that make data actually mean something.\nGet in touch: zain.ghias@mail.utoronto.ca"
