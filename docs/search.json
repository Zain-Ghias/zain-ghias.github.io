De-duplication: removed duplicates by (start_time, end_time, bike_id)\n4. Derived columns: hour_of_day, weekday, is_member\n5. Data issues log: tracked anomalies (e.g., negative durations, midnight spikes)\n\n\nDecision note: trips &lt; 2 minutes flagged (unlock/relocate). Included in totals but excluded in some visuals."

I‚Äôm planning to take more ML and stats courses next year, and I‚Äôm open to getting involved in research if it‚Äôs in something exciting or meaningful.\nI like volleyball, table tennis, and basketball, and I try to balance screen time with touching grass and going on long walks, partly for my sanity.\nThanks for stopping by. Excited to see where this journey goes.\nGet in touch: zain.ghias@mail.utoronto.ca"
