    "text": "Question. For a scoped snapshot: How did Bike Share Toronto usage differ between March 2023 and March 2024—by hour and weekday/weekend—and what changed in the member/casual mix?\nWhy these months? March alone already has ~500k+ trips across the two years—enough to reveal strong hourly patterns without boiling the ocean. I’ll scale the scope later.\nWhy I’m doing this. I’ve been seeing micromobility (bikes/scooters) all over Mississauga—often parked, sometimes deserted—and got curious about real usage and adoption. This project is my way to quantify it: start tight (two months), then expand into comparisons, models, and policy context (e-scooter restrictions).\nStack.

I’m planning to take more ML and stats courses next year, and I’m open to getting involved in research if it’s in something exciting or meaningful.\nI like volleyball, table tennis, and basketball, and I try to balance screen time with touching grass and going on long walks, partly for my sanity.\nThanks for stopping by.
