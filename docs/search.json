    "text": "Project Purpose\n\nMotivation\nLiving in Mississauga, I rarely saw Lime scooters or shared bikes in active use. Many looked idle or abandoned mid-trip.\nThat raised a question: are these systems being used effectively, or just growing in size?\nI tried to access Lime GBFS but the process stalled, so I pivoted to Bike Share Toronto open data, which is clean and well structured. The work evolved into a business-style analysis that checks if ridership growth kept pace with network expansion.\n\n\nCore Question\n\nHow did Bike Share Toronto usage differ between March 2023 and March 2024 by hour, by weekday vs weekend, and by user type?\n\n\n\nWhy These Months?\nEach monthly file has hundreds of thousands of trips, so a single month can be representative.\nI chose March 2023 and March 2024 to keep scope focused while allowing a true year-over-year comparison.\n\n\nTools & Stack\nExcel (cleaning and validation) · Tableau (visualization) · Python/SQL (planned automation)"

    "text": "Financial Extension — Business and Revenue Analysis\n\nWhy a financial view?\nBike Share Toronto’s open data does not include pricing, ledger, or cost fields. To connect ridership to business outcomes, I built a simple financial layer:\n\nTrip-level revenue model using public pricing from City background files (2023/2024) and the current pricing page.\n\nCost proxy of 30% of revenue, guided by NACTO’s shared micromobility benchmarks (typical range 25–35%).\n\nTransparent rules: 2023 annual-member rides are set to $0 per trip (model type and overage billing not available). A small set of 2023 annual trips over 30 minutes (n=806) was flagged and excluded from revenue.\n\nScope: Membership fees, taxes, and non-operational costs are out of scope. Results are modeled estimates to illustrate direction, not accounting figures.\n\nWhat to look for below:\n1) YoY Revenue, Cost, and Gross Profit KPI cards.\n2) Revenue by day of week to match commuter patterns.\n3) Top 10 trips by modeled revenue.\n4) Bike-type split (classic vs e-bike) and member vs casual contribution.\nThe goal is to turn usage data into a concise business readout that supports decisions on pricing, promotions, and operations.\n\n\n\nFindings\n\nRevenue: $711,804 in Mar 2024 vs $628,748 in Mar 2023 (+13.2%)\n\nCost (proxy): $213,541 in 2024 using a 30% operating ratio\n\nGross Profit: $498,263 in 2024 vs $440,124 in 2023 (+13.2%)\n\nWeekday revenue peaks midweek, matching commuter demand\n\nClassic bikes generated ~94% of March 2024 revenue; e-bikes are smaller but a clear upsell\n\n\n\nInterpretation and Suggestions\n\nEfficiency: GP growth tracks revenue, suggesting scalable operations rather than cost inflation\n\nDemand focus: Wednesday and Thursday are reliable cash-flow days; weekends are an opportunity for promotions or partner offers\n\nGrowth play: Most per-trip dollars come from casuals; nudge frequent casuals toward annual memberships to stabilize demand and retention\n\n\n\n\nHow This Was Modeled\n\nNew Excel Fields\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Field\nPurpose\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nEst.

My work focuses on React, Next.js, Tailwind, and Plotly, where I’ve been learning to merge design, data, and storytelling to make information more usable.\nPreviously, I worked at Quor, a Toronto startup, as a Frontend Developer Intern, helping design and build a cross-platform mobile app in React Native. Those startup experiences taught me to be adaptable, to pick up new tools on the fly, and to figure things out as I go.\nLately, I’ve been expanding into data analytics and business analysis, combining my statistics background with technical skills to uncover trends and communicate insights. I’m also exploring machine learning and data visualization, aiming to bridge the gap between analysis and product decisions.\nOutside of code and coursework, I try to stay grounded. I like volleyball, table tennis, and long walks around Mississauga to balance the screen time (and touch grass for my sanity).\nI’m naturally curious about how things work, whether it’s a dataset, a business model, or a React component, and I enjoy translating that curiosity into projects that make data actually mean something.\nGet in touch: zain.ghias@mail.utoronto.ca"
